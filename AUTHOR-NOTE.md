# Author’s Note

Yes, I wrote this work. The metaphors, structure, and tone emerged through my own reflection and attention. But I do not seek to own it—not as an identity, brand, or intellectual asset.

Anonymity here is not a game or disguise. It is a principle: to let the work move on its own, free of biography or credit. I want it to resonate or fail based on the pattern alone, not on who wrote it.

If asked directly, I will not lie. But I may answer with restraint, because the truth is not about authorship—it is about intention.

I wrote this to return something to the field. That is enough.
